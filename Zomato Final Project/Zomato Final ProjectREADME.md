# Zomato Restaurant Analysis
This was the seventh project I completed as part of the TripleTen Business Intelligence Analytics Program. It was an individual project aimed at demonstrating the full range of skills I had developed throughout the course. The objective was to analyze restaurant data and provide data-driven recommendations to help optimize revenue.

### Process
* Cleaned the data by checking for duplicates, standardizing formats, removing irrelevant columns
* Formed research questions and hypotheses to test for
* Uploaded data onto Tableau and joined two different tables together for analysis
* Created four visualizations to look for trends, patterns and further insights
* A detailed report was created demonstrating the findings.
